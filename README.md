To properly configure the project you need to use the database schema provided in the DATABASE folder. Use the database server credentials to configure the connectivity and then compile and run the source code.

I need your contribution in this project to make it centralised system. This way the software should be able to allow multiple stores/branches. RestSharp maybe a way forward for now!
